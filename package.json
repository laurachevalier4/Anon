  "description": "## Overview Anon is a website for anonymous polling and in-depth visualizations of results based on user demographics. Users can post questions to the site for other users to vote on, and they will be able to see the results of these polls visualized based on the demographics of voters. Each poll is only valid for a set amount of time, and a user can only post a poll if they have enough points to do so; they can accumulate points by voting on other polls. Not only does this permit open data transactions but it gives all users a glimpse into how certain 'types' of people respond to all sorts of questions. Perhaps we'll find that people fall perfectly into their stereotypes. More likely, we will be surprised to find that people aren't at all what you would expect.",
